New Prime Minister Liz Truss will unveil plans to limit energy bill rises on Thursday, spending billions to protect people from soaring prices.

Typical household energy bills could be capped at around £2,500 a year, with firms also likely to get some relief.

It is unclear how long the support will last, but the government is expected to borrow at least £100bn to pay for it.

Currently, a typical household's annual gas and electricity bill is due to rise from £1,971 to £3,549 in October.

Experts and charities have warned that without help with soaring energy bills, lives will be at risk this winter, as people struggle to afford basic day-to-day living costs.

The increase in consumers' bills follows sharp rises in wholesale gas prices largely due to the conflict in Ukraine, which has reduced supplies of Russian gas.

Ahead of the announcement, Ms Truss said she knew families and firms were worried about "how they are going to make ends meet this autumn and winter".

"Putin's war in Ukraine and weaponisation of gas supply in Europe is causing global prices to rise - and this has only made clearer that we must boost our long-term energy security and supply," she said.

She pledged to "tackle the root cause of these problems, so that we are not in this position again".

To limit the amount customers' bills go up by, the government is expected to compensate energy firms for the difference between the wholesale price for gas and electricity they pay and the amount they can charge customers.
